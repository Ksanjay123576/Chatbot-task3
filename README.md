**Overview of the Chatbot Code**

The provided chatbot code demonstrates how to build a rule-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques from the NLTK library. It preprocesses user inputs, detects intents based on predefined keywords, and provides responses accordingly.

**Purpose**

The chatbot is designed to:

Understand basic user queries through intent detection.
Respond appropriately with predefined answers.
Maintain a conversational loop until the user exits.

**Key Steps in the Code**

 **Preprocessing User Input**
 
The preprocess function prepares the user's input for analysis:
Tokenization: Breaks the input into individual words using nltk.word_tokenize.
Lowercasing: Converts words to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
Lemmatization: Reduces words to their base form (e.g., "running" → "run") for better keyword matching.

** Intent Detection**

The chatbot uses keyword-based intent detection:
A keywords dictionary defines intents (e.g., "greeting", "weather") and the associated keywords.
The chatbot checks if any keyword from an intent matches the user's preprocessed input.

**Responses**

Each intent has a set of predefined responses stored in the responses dictionary.
Once an intent is identified, the chatbot selects a random response associated with that intent.

**Chat Loop**

The chatbot function handles the interaction:
Continuously prompts the user for input.
Processes the input and generates a response.
Ends the conversation when the user types "exit" or "quit."

**Key Components**

NLTK Features Used

word_tokenize: Splits user input into individual words for processing.
WordNetLemmatizer: Reduces words to their base form (e.g., "cars" → "car").

Logic for Responses

Keyword Matching: Checks for predefined keywords in user input to identify the user's intent.

Random Response Selection: Keeps the chatbot's replies varied and conversational.

**Modularity**

Functions are logically organized:

preprocess for input processing.
get_response for intent detection and response generation.
chatbot for managing the conversation loop.
Sample Conversation Flow
User Interaction:
User Input: "Hi"

Intent Detected: "greeting"
Response: "Hello!"
User Input: "Tell me about the weather."

Intent Detected: "weather"
Response: "I'm not a weather bot, but I can help you find weather APIs!"
User Input: "What is your name?"

Intent Detected: "name"
Response: "I don't have a name yet, but you can give me one!"
User Input: "exit"

Chat Ends.
Strengths of the Code
Simple and Beginner-Friendly:

Uses basic NLP techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and keyword matching.
Easy to understand and modify.

Expandable:

New intents and responses can be added by updating the keywords and responses dictionaries.

Error Handling:

If no intent matches, the chatbot provides a default response.
Limitations

Rule-Based Nature:

Limited to predefined keywords and responses.
Cannot understand complex or unseen queries.

No Learning Capability:

Unlike machine learning models, the chatbot cannot improve with usage.

No Context Awareness:

The chatbot doesn’t remember previous conversations, so responses are independent of earlier inputs.
Potential Enhancements

Expand the Keyword-Intent Mapping:
Add more intents and responses to handle diverse queries.

Integrate APIs:
For dynamic responses, such as weather data, connect to external APIs.

Switch to ML/NLP Models:
Use trained models (e.g., with spaCy or scikit-learn) for more accurate intent detection.

Add Context Management:
Use state tracking to maintain context during a conversation.
